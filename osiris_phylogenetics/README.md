### Dependencies
This set of tools *does not* include dependencies. Please consult tool_conf_osirisDemo.xml and the documentation of each tool to determine the programs you need in order to run each tool.

Osiris uses wrappers for tools installed on the server. Some of the wrappers require the tools to be installed in specific directories. Consult the code for each wrapper to figure out where these tools need to be installed.
